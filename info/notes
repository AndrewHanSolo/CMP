HIGH PRIORITY

matplotlib should make directories in which to save plots if they dont exist

test if getHistograms can do polytonically distributed bins
clean up plot preprocessing and postprocessing. constructfig
axesLimits should be set after TrackFile analysis in constructor function
axesLimits should be set to max value of property
don't forget about comparePlots
Plots need to be scaled



-----------------------------------------
LOW PRIORITY

add the field functions as seen in the Cell Particle Tracking doc - angular histogram
dictionaries for Experiment settings and trackfile coordinates
test settingsLabel
TFF line 56
label on colorbar
don't hardcode settings

weightedAverage should return Nan if error and not 0



-----------------------------------------
TO DO


use structs instead of dicts and have dict linking strings to structs for user
TrackClassGlobals should be structured in 
plotScatter and heatMapVisualization should be merged together, have one master 4d scatterplot func
metadata summary function
move wordDoc to readme
gui
tests
plot path of all cells moving from one origin
compare plots - side by side plotting of various experiment plots

search for REMOVE and TODO keywords
