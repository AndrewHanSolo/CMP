HIGH PRIORITY

matplotlib should make directories in which to save plots if they dont exist

test if getHistograms can do polytonically distributed bins
clean up plot preprocessing and postprocessing. constructfig
remove redundancy - getWeightedAvgCorr vs getBinData
analysis should no longer compute all original fields
make selectFrames iterable on any plot
axesLimits should be set after TrackFile analysis in constructor function
axesLimits should be set to max value of property
don't forget about comparePlots



-----------------------------------------
LOW PRIORITY

add the field functions as seen in the Cell Particle Tracking doc - angular histogram
dictionaries for Experiment settings and trackfile coordinates
test settingsLabel
TFF line 56
label on colorbar



-----------------------------------------
TO DO

metadata summary function
move wordDoc to readme
gui
tests
plot path of all cells moving from one origin
compare plots - side by side plotting of various experiment plots

test
