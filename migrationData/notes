test if getHistograms can do polytonically distributed bins
clean up plot preprocessing and postprocessing. constructfig
remove redundancy - getWeightedAvgCorr vs getBinData
analysis should no longer compute all original fields
make selectFrames iterable on any plot
axesLimits should be set after TrackFile analysis in constructor function
axesLimits should be set to max value of property

don't forget about comparePlots
