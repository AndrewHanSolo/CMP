Cell Migration Analysis Platform (CMP)

CMP was developed to assist the analysis of single-cell migration data generated using a novel cell migration experiment platform developed by HMao et. al.

Mao Experiment in brief

The migration chamber is a PDMS mold that has two wells at opposite ends
connected by a 1 cm long channel through which chemical gradients can be
established and cells can migrate. The migration channel has an exposed bottom
that can be placed on a desired topographical surface, and by filling one well
with a chemical of known concentration and the other well with a blank
solution, beautiful linear gradients that last for more than 24 hours can be
established. Once the environment is constructed, cells can be seeded into the
chamber and observed via microscopy imaging. In order to capture migration
occurring across the entire 1 cm channel for 12+ hours, a programmable stage
is used to generate time-lapse videos at various positions along the gradient
simultaneously. Cell blobs are detected by gaussian filtering in each frame, and migration tracks are reconstructed from blob positions using a linear assignment problem algorithm. For one experiment there exist multiple track files that correspond to known positions within the experiment. 

CMP Features
-Modular import/save, filtering, analysis, excel serialization, and plotting of track data
-Tunable analysis scope and resolution that supports spationtemporal and measurement scanning
-Turn-key single-execution scripts that provide data import, comprehensive filtering, analysis, excel serialization, and plotting of (multi)experiment data sets
-Flexibile for easy dynamic addition of new track dimensions and track measurement functions by taking advantage of python introspection and reflection
-Multi-file experiment reconstruction and experiment parameter customizability for calculations with accurate units
-Functions for multi-experiment comparison and cross-correlations
-Simple code structure for accessibility to non programmers, and easy extensibility
